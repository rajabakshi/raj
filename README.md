A weather app is a digital application designed to provide real-time and forecasted weather information to users.  
It leverages data from meteorological sources, satellites, and weather stations to deliver accurate and up-to-date details on various atmospheric conditions. 
Users can access information such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and precipitation forecasts, allowing them to plan their activities accordingly.
Weather apps often include interactive features, such as radar maps, severe weather alerts, and customizable notifications, enhancing user experience and safety. 
Whether for daily planning, travel, or simply staying informed, weather apps play a crucial role in keeping users connected to the dynamic nature of the environment.
